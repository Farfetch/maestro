**Maestro** is a load testing tool, building on our years of experience in the load and performance testing industry. It provides a clean, approachable way of running Jmeter based tests.

## Features

#### Distributed & Scalable

The core concept of having agents deployed inside your infrastructure gives a lot of flexibility to make the tests stable, secure, and able to ***support the simulation of thousands requests/second***. 

#### Collaborative environment

*Real-time monitoring*, *Collaboration over results*, *Programmability* are core things that Maestro focused on to make sure you can collaborate with your teams and improve over time.
