**Maestro** is a load testing tool, building on our years of experience in the load and performance testing industry. It provides a clean, approachable way of running Jmeter based tests.

> **NOTICE:** Maestro is under development and there might be some breaking changes over versions. We do have regular releases and are really welcome to get feedback.

## Features

#### WEB-based UI

Maestro provides a list of endpoints from where you can analyze your test execution in real-time. There is a full overview of all charts and use cases available in the [Introduction section](https://farfetch.github.io/maestro/docs/intro)

#### Distributed & Scalable

The core concept of having agents deployed inside your infrastructure gives a lot of flexibility to make the tests stable, secure, and able to **_support the simulation of thousands requests/second_**.

#### Collaborative environment

_Real-time monitoring_, _Collaboration over results_, _Programmability_ are core things that Maestro focused on to make sure you can collaborate with your teams and improve over time.
